# Port Scanner

## Objective  
The **Port Scanner** project was developed to identify open ports on a target system by scanning a range of ports and detecting active services. This tool helps security professionals and network administrators assess potential vulnerabilities in their network infrastructure.  

## Skills Learned  
- Understanding of **network ports** and their role in communication.  
- Working with **Python's socket library** for network scanning.  
- Identifying **open, closed, and filtered ports**.  
- Implementing **multi-threading** for faster scanning.  
- Enhancing **cybersecurity awareness** by recognizing exposed services.  

## Tools Used  
- **Python** – Core language. 
- **Socket Library** – Used for establishing network connections.
